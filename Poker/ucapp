Please consider that I have been fully employed during my college career, and at times my finances have take priority over full-time enrollement. During the my second year at Modesto Junior College (F2009 - S2010) I experienced period of homelessness and I was forced to cut back on classes during spring semmester of that year. Also, Fall 2010 - Spring 2011 at Santa Barbara City College was a difficult period for me as I was working full time and transitioning to a new city. I now work part-time and since Fall 2010 have improved my schoolwork.
